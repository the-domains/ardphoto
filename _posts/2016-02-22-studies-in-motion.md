**W**here there is water there is change, that change, is constant.  Water is in a constant state of change.  In the light of a Maine, summer dawn, warm lake water feathers into the cool atmosphere.   
I stand and watch the water, air and land come alive.    
The summer sun is rising fast in the NE.  These are long days in the North.  The sun must follow a long arc from the NE to the NW, any further north and we would not have nightfall.  The loons call from up lake, the White Throated Sparrow that woke me at 4:00am, sings with is slow well defined simple casual tempo song.

Looking into the reflections of the clouds in the pond water, I tried to list the elements of the natural world which remain in constant motion.  Water was easy to add to my list.  But, how can I capture that motion?  
If  my exposure is to long, the water surface will be smooth, and undefined.  If my shutter is to fast the water will be with out motion.

Then there is the question of image color.  Adjusting image color and contrast can render inherent patterns in the moving water.  Where is the water I observed, has it merged with cold ocean currents. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6e953a12-f6cf-4976-b697-bd44efcb3d85.jpg)

Absent are the boundaries of edge and in between.

How soft and supple, what magic is locked within.

Reflections of the clouds over head add patterns of their own.

Even in this random dance patterns do emerge. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3b39da13-c15a-493e-88e4-72e1f46177e6.jpg)

Nature repeats it's form.  Wave of water waves of light, there is coherence to the rules of  Nature.
