Under the "Winona Pines"Bridgton, Maine. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c1dc76ec9eb54dfa94c5cc42681450f0890e9cd6.jpg)

This is the north woods.  Winona has been on Moose pond for one hundred years.  The summer still has warmth. The season is coming to an end for my family.  We'll be going back to the "Valley of The Sun", Phoenix, AZ, where yesterday the high was 114f.  Here in south western Maine, a steady breeze blows from the north.  It's the first week of August.  In 1 1/2 months this region will experience it's first frost of autumn.  Another four weeks into the future the leave will be at peak color and the local roads will be heavy with traffic heading to the Fryeburg Fair.  The Fryeburg Fair, is one of those Maine events that is tied explicitly to the Fall season.  As with any rural fair there are lines of barns housing pigs, goats, cows, draft horses, chickens, pies, cakes, jam, their owners seeking the coveted blue ribbon.  ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/843972770c3c397ed80773576b17843ec79f6e45.jpg)

The late afternoon sun shines under the canopy of lodgepole pines.  Each well over 100 feet tall.
