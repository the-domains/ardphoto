About three years ago I was diagnosed
with ADHD.  I can now see the pattern in the  distraction and  obsession which plagued me for most of my life.

I gained a bit of insight into
why my world was so maddening all those years.One of the effects of ADHD on my
career is that I find my self an emerging artist at age 53\.  I am also Dyslexic; I was diagnosed in
second grade.  Over the years my dyslexic
patterns have become more easily recognized.  One behavior I have noticed is that I think backwards.When writing I often construct my sentences
the opposite of correct. I also am becoming aware of
the connection between hearing and spelling.

Dyslexia is one of the reasons I
include writing into my projects.               My
major baggage from growing up dyslexic is shame.   Add in an impactful degree of ADHD and shame
feeds, depression, frustration, anger, confusion and lots of
distraction.  Now
imagine we are playing a game in which you are in a forest of Southern Maine.    
A proper forest at this latitude
should have a forest floor covered in deep soft mats of pine needles, leaves
and fallen trees.  There is a canopy,
present are large oaks, maples, white pine, red pine, hemlock, yellow pine and
birch.  Below the canopy the light is
open, broad, subdued while at the same time rich in warm tannin colored hues of brown and amber. With your eyes closed, you can still sense you
are in the forest.

The forest smell is
strong with pine and hemlock stronger still is the scent of rich dark decaying
matter under there
is a task you must perform.  Keep your
eyes closed.  When ready begin walking
forward in any direction.  When you are
stopped by an obstruction stop, open your eyes and observe the barrier in your
path.

When you're ready closes your eyes
and continue your journey.                    You are
allowed to adjust your path to avoid true hazardous elements of the forest.  After twenty steps you must open your eyes,
and repeat the cycle. Determine an amount of time that you will play this
game.  The goal is to capture images of
your journey.

This
is how I photographed, "A Walk in the Maine Forest".                                  I am interested in what I would call near
field perception.                         
"Near Field" would
describe the space within one to two feet of you eyes.  Photographing in this zone, can feel intimate
and personal.  In some ways I think I am
attempting experience visually and capture what           another person would have seen
or even felt.  Near Field is a space that
fills our field of vision.  What does a
child made to stand face into a corner in school see, I know he sees the wall,
yet what else is embedded into that visual moment. ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0f48e07a9130244d3014d9d449cd4940/passthrough.jpg?height=600&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F9b06557b81dfe90512b8012e2136c558044cbd0f.jpg&width=493)

Also present in this work is a strong
emotional, psychological energy.         Prior to developing this project I had been thinking about how I could convey my feelings of frustration, obstructive barriers, roadblocks, failure, and
success, which had consumed my daily life.

My question was, "what do we overcome, or, not
overcome when attempting to attain challenges and goals. With, "A Walk in
a Forest in Maine", I attempt to capture an intuitive perception of moments of explorative
vision.  My vision, catalyzed through confrontation with the obstructions inherent in life, certainly in our minds, takes the form of the regeneration of a plant, its seeds  lofted on the winds of the seasons and the promise of new beginnings.
