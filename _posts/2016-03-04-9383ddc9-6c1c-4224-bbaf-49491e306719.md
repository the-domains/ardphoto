About three years ago I was diagnosed
with ADHD.  Can see the pattern of
distraction and consuming obsession.

I gained a bit of insight into
why my world was so maddening all those years.One of the effects of ADHD on my
career is that I find my self an emerging artist at age 53\.  I am also Dyslexic; I was diagnosed in
second grade.  Over the years my dyslexic
patterns have become more easily recognized.  One behavior I have noticed is that I think backwards.When writing I often construct my sentences
the opposite of correct.

I also am becoming aware of
the connection between hearing and spelling.

Dyslexia is one of the reasons I
include writing into my projects.My
major carry over from growing up dyslexic is shame.Add in an impactful degree of ADHD and shame
feeds, depression, frustration, shame, anger, confusion and lots of
distraction. Now
imagine we are playing a game in which you are in a forest of Southern Maine.  A proper forest at this latitude
should have a forest floor covered in deep soft mats of pine needles, leaves
and fallen trees.There is a canopy,
present are large oaks, maples, white pine, red pine, hemlock, yellow pine and
birch.  Below the canopy the light is
open, broad, subdued while at the same time rich in warm tannin dyed hues.  Even with your eyes closed, you can sense you
are in the forest.

The forest smell is
strong with pine and hemlock stronger still is the sent of rich dark decaying
matter under there
is a task you must preform.Keep your
eyes closed.  When ready begin walking
forward in any direction.  When you are
stopped by an obstruction stops, open your eyes and observe the barrier in your
path.

When your ready closes your eyes
and continues your journey.  You are
allowed to adjust your path to avoid truly hazards elements of the forest.  After twenty steps you must open your eyes,
and repeat the cycle. Determine an amount of time that you will play this
game.  The goal is to capture images of
your journey.

This
is how I photographed, "A Walk in the Maine Forest".I am interested in what I would call near
field perception.  "Near Field" would
describe the space with in one to two feet of you eyes.  Photographing in this zone, can feel intimate
and personal.  In some ways I think I am
attempting experience visually and capture what an other person would have seen
or even felt.  Near Field is a space that
fills our field of vision.  What does a
child made to stand face into a corner in school see, I know he sees the wall,
yet what else is embedded into that moment. 

Also present in this work is a strong
emotional, psychological energy. I had been thinking about how I could convey
feelings of frustration, obstructive barriers, road blocks, failure, and
success.

What do we overcome, or, not
overcome when attempting to attain self challenges and goals. With, "A Walk in
a Forest in Maine", I attempt an intuitive perception of moments of explorative
vision.
